# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- Notes:  -->
<!-- The error 404 - indicates that the server could not find the resource you requested, which in this case is the root URL /. This is because the app.py script currently doesn't serve any frontend or provide a root route. We need to set up a basic route to serve the frontend files, typically using the send_from_directory function from Flask to serve static files.

Here's how we can do it:

Serve Static Files: Serve the static frontend files from the React build directory.
Ensure Proper CORS Handling: Ensure that the CORS handling is correctly set up.
Steps to Fix
------------
Build the React Frontend:

First, make sure your React frontend is built and ready to be served by the Flask backend.

Navigate to the frontend directory and run the build command: npm run build
This will create a build directory in your frontend folder containing the compiled static files.
Then you can do npm start -->
